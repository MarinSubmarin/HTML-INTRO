                <p id="intro">My name is Mărienuțiu Marian Ilie, I'm 20 years old and a PC lover.</p>
                <p id="info1">I'm a 2nd year student at the "Aurel Vlaicu University" in Arad, Romania <br> that is interested in the IT workspace and I'm willing to do everything it <br> takes to become an IT expert.</p>
                <p id="info2">I'm currently studying "Automation and Applied Informathics", mostly <br> leaning into Quality Assurance Testing, manual testing for now, <br> hopefully automatic after a few years of working in the industry.</p>
                <p id="info3">Even though I don't have experience working as a Programmer <br> I can still code in C , C++, HTML + CSS and a little bit of SQL. <br> (speaking of coding, I coded a Vending Machine in C, check it out!)</p>
                <a href="https://github.com/MarinSubmarin">This is my Github page.</a>
                <p id="info4">On my github page you can find my projects and my CV. <br> Romanian is my mother tongue and I speak English at an Advanced level. <br> I even got a C1 Cambridge Certificate!</p>
                <p id="info5">As a last statement I would like to say that I put my all into everything I do,<br> and in programmer fashion, I like being as efficient as possible too, I think <br> that wasting time is not in anybody's interests, so everyday I learn little by <br> little to become that IT expert that I was talking about. </p>
